# AmazinAxel.com Website

üíª This is my portfolio website built with Sveltekit and Bun, hosted on Cloudflare Pages.

## ü•± Boring stuff

Use `bun i` to install, then use `bun run dev` to develop quickly and `bun run deploy` to deploy to Pages. Use `bun run build` and `bun run preview` to preview site builds.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Word of Warning

I'm really terrible at Sveltekit, and most of this is probably not coded well. If you're looking for a site to develop upon, do not use this! That being said, I'm trying to improve upon Svelte, so if you have any design recommendations/performance tips, do let me know!
