# 🌐 AmazinAxel.com Site

My portfolio website - built with Sveltekit and Bun, hosted on Cloudflare Pages.

Features my help pages (automagically parses markdown and features admonitons), Minecraft development tools, and more.

## Localhost development

Bun is preferred over node/npm for development and deployment.

Use `bun i` to install, then use `bun run dev` to develop quickly and `bun run deploy` to deploy to Pages. Use `bun run build && bun run preview` to build & preview.
