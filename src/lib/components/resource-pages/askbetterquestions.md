title: Ask better questions, get better help
---

<div class="card">

It's difficult to help when the problem isn't clear or not enough information is given. Please try your best to follow these guidelines when asking questions so others can help you better.

<div class="innerCard">

**~** When you ask a question, please provide as much information as you possibly can and explain your problem clearly.

**~** Provide code, logs, attempted solutions, and related information in your question where applicable.

**~** Be straightforward, concise, and explain everything as clearly as possible.

**~** Try to use grammar and proper English while explaining your question so your question isn't misunderstood.

**~** Ask about your *problem*, not your attempted solution. [Read more about 'The XY Problem'.](https://xyproblem.info/)

**~** Many helpers are volunteers who are working on their own projects too. Please be respectful and mindful to their time by not pinging them for help repeatedly.
