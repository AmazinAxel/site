    This subpage is dedicated to the topic of <i>learning how to learn.</i> It may seem confusing, but the success
    of understanding the <i>right way to learn</i> and asking for help will improve 
    the way you think, do, and write.

<p>
    The goal of these articles are to keep things simple and short. People (especially beginners) don't want
    to read 1000 word articles to learn basic topics, they want to gloss over a page and get the gist. The point
    of this is to keep everything <i>as short and simple as possible</i> while including all information necessary
    to understand the topic.

    When you're first learning how to code, it may be common to ask for help on a forum. I've compiled a list
    of sources and created a simplified yet strategic summary of important subjects for beginners to understand
    and comprehend. Feel free to link here to teach others on some of these important subjects.
